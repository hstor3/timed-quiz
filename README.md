# Timed Quiz

## Overview

HTML 

For the HTML file, I created a basic file and added different sections for where I wanted everything to be displayed.


JavaScript

For my JavaScript file, I started out by creating a list of variable linked to the HTML file to use in my functions. Then I created a function to start the quiz (sort through answers and start the countdown) when I click on the Start button. Next I created some sample questions and answers so that I could build a question card to display where my questions and answers would be displayed. Next I created a function to check if the answers are correct and deduct time if they were incorrect. Lastly, I made a function to save the score to local storage and to the quiz page.


CSS

For the CSS file, I started out by centering everything and spacing things out so everything would be easy to see. I chose neutral colors and a JavaScript looking font to make things look more relevant.
